This is a pristine, exploding field that is flooding biologists with a new wave of data, each with its own specificities in terms of complexity and information content. The integrative analysis of genomic data, collected at different molecular layers from diverse cell populations, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems. However, the combination of different single-cell genomic signals is computationally challenging, as these data are intrinsically heterogeneous for experimental, technical and biological reasons. Here, we describe the computational methods for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data, with a focus on the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and on the joint analysis of multimodal signals from individual cells.</jats:p>",

However, computationally effective methods for the integration of these inherent sparse and heterogeneous data are lacking. Here, we present a single-cell multimodal variational autoencoder model, which combines three types of joint-learning strategies with a probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model to learn the joint latent features that accurately represent these multilayer profiles. Studies on both simulated datasets and real datasets demonstrate that it has more preferable capability (i) dissecting cellular heterogeneity in the joint-learning space, (ii) denoising and imputing data and (iii) constructing the association between multilayer omics data, which can be used for understanding transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.</jats:p>",

UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex non-linear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>UnionCom software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/UnionCom.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an autoencoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 90% and 78% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples, respectively.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>https://github.com/ratschlab/scim.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are challenging. Existing manifold alignment methods demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on single-cell multi-omics data integration, but they are often limited by requiring that single-cell datasets be derived from the same underlying cellular structure.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In this study, we present Pamona, a partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance-based manifold alignment framework that integrates heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics datasets with the aim of delineating and representing the shared and dataset-specific cellular structures across modalities. We formulate this task as a partial manifold alignment problem and develop a partial Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework to solve it. Pamona identifies both shared and dataset-specific cells based on the computed probabilistic couplings of cells across datasets, and it aligns cellular modalities in a common low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving both shared and dataset-specific structures. Our framework can easily incorporate prior information, such as cell type annotations or cell-cell correspondence, to further improve alignment quality. We evaluated Pamona on a comprehensive set of publicly available benchmark datasets. We demonstrated that Pamona can accurately identify shared and dataset-specific cells, as well as faithfully recover and align cellular structures of heterogeneous single-cell modalities in a common space, outperforming the comparable existing methods.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Availabilityand implementation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Pamona software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/Pamona.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Supplementary information</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.</jats:p>",

Several unsupervised algorithms can align heterogeneous single-cell measurements in a shared space, enabling the creation of mappings between single cells in different data domains. However, these algorithms require hyperparameter tuning for high-quality alignments, which is difficult in an unsupervised setting without correspondence information for validation. We present Single-Cell alignment using Optimal Transport (SCOT), an unsupervised learning algorithm that uses Gromov Wasserstein-based optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics datasets. We compare the alignment performance of SCOT with state-of-the-art algorithms on four simulated and two real-world datasets. SCOT performs on par with state-of-the-art methods but is faster and requires tuning fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm for SCOT to use Gromov Wasserstein distance to guide the parameter selection. Thus, unlike previous methods, SCOT aligns well without using any orthogonal correspondence information to pick the hyperparameters.

We evaluate methods according to scalability, usability, and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation.</jats:p><jats:p>Using 14 evaluation metrics, we find that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, BBKNN, Scanorama, and scVI perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks; Seurat v3 performs well on simpler tasks with distinct biological signals; and methods that prioritize batch removal perform best for ATAC-seq data integration. Our freely available reproducible python module can be used to identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods, and improve method development.</jats:p>",

Here, we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability</jats:title><jats:p>Installation instructions, documentation, tutorials, and CITE-seq datasets are available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.satijalab.org/seurat\">http://www.satijalab.org/seurat</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec>",

While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility – for example generating paired measurements of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq – wide-spread application of joint profiling is challenging due to the experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging a novel interoperable neural network model, BABEL can generate scRNA-seq directly from a cell’s scATAC-seq, and vice versa. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multi-omic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to new biological contexts not seen during training. For example, starting from scATAC-seq of patient derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated scRNA-seq that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of the experimental BCC scRNA-seq data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as CITE-seq, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.</jats:p>",

However, both the rows and the columns can represent different entities in different data matrices, making such integration a computational challenge that has only been solved approximately by existing approaches. Here, we present bindSC, a single-cell data integration tool that realizes simultaneous alignment of the rows and the columns between data matrices without making approximations. Using datasets produced by multiomics technologies as gold standard, we show that bindSC generates accurate multimodal co-embeddings that are substantially more accurate than those generated by existing approaches. Particularly, bindSC effectively integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data towards discovering key regulatory elements in cancer cell-lines and mouse cells. It achieved accurate integration of both common and rare cell types (&lt;0.25% abundance) in a novel mouse retina cell atlas generated using the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC+RNA kit. Further, it achieves unbiased integration of scRNA-seq and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data derived from mouse brain cortex samples. Lastly, it demonstrated efficacy in delineating immune cell types via integrating single-cell RNA and protein data.

Various methods have been developed for detecting SV (spatially variable) genes, with distinct spatial expression patterns. However, the accuracy of using these SV genes in clustering has not been thoroughly studied. On the other hand, in single cell resolution sequencing data without spatial context, clustering analysis is usually done on highly variable (HV) genes. Here we investigate if integrating SV genes and HV genes from spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering performance beyond using SV genes alone. We examined three methods that detect SV genes, including Giotto, spatialDE, and SPARK, and evaluated six methods that integrate different features measured from the same samples including MOFA+, scVI, Seurat v4, CIMLR, SNF, and the straightforward concatenation approach. We applied these methods on 19 real datasets from three different spatial transcriptomics technologies (merFISH, SeqFISH+, and Visium) as well as 20 simulated datasets of varying spatial expression conditions. Our evaluations show that MOFA+ and simple concatenation have good performances in general, despite the variations among datasets and spatial transcriptomics platforms. This work shows that integrating highly variable and spatially variable genes in the spatial transcriptomics data can improve clustering beyond using spatially variable genes only. It also provides practical guides on the choices of computational methods to accomplish this goal.</jats:p>",

Here we present a novel benchmark dataset (scMARK), that consists of 100,000 cells over 10 studies and can test how well models unify data from different scRNA studies. We also introduce a two-step framework that uses supervised models, to evaluate how well unsupervised models integrate scRNA data from the 10 studies. Using this framework, we show that the Variational Autoencoder, scVI, represents the only tool tested that can integrate scRNA studies at scale. Overall, this work paves the way to creating large scRNA atlases and ‘off-the-shelf’ analysis tools.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold alignment algorithm, MMD-MA, for integrating multiple measurements carried out on disjoint aliquots of a given population of cells. Effectively, MMD-MA performs an <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> co-assay by embedding cells measured in different ways into a learned latent space. In the MMD-MA algorithm, single-cell data points from multiple domains are aligned by optimizing an objective function with three components: (1) a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) term to encourage the differently measured points to have similar distributions in the latent space, (2) a distortion term to preserve the structure of the data between the input space and the latent space, and (3) a penalty term to avoid collapse to a trivial solution. Notably, MMD-MA does not require any correspondence information across data modalities, either between the cells or between the features. Furthermore, MMD-MA’s weak distributional requirements for the domains to be aligned allow the algorithm to integrate heterogeneous types of single cell measures, such as gene expression, DNA accessibility, chromatin organization, methylation, and imaging data. We demonstrate the utility of MMD-MA in simulation experiments and using a real data set involving single-cell gene expression and methylation data.</jats:p>",

However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.</jats:p>",

Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for pre-processing, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and ADT expression analysis, ADT evaluation, ligand-receptor interaction analysis, and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data. We show the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single modality profiling. Furthermore, we illustrate the pre-processing steps in CiteFuse and in particular a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of CiteFuse for the integrative analysis of transcriptome and epitope profiles from CITE-seq data.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is possible to combine multiple latent-variable models of the same data by multiplying their probability distributions together and then renormalizing. This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the central problems in machine learning and pattern recognition is to develop appropriate representations for complex data. We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed. </jats:p>",

However, for many tasks, paired training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to translate an image from a source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ such that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the distribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \\rightarrow X$ and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \\approx X$ (and vice versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly common in many types of natural and physical systems (especially biological systems) to have different types of measurements performed on the same underlying system. In such settings, it is important to align the manifolds arising from each measurement in order to integrate such data and gain an improved picture of the system. We tackle this problem using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recently, GANs have been utilized to try to find correspondences between sets of samples. However, these GANs are not explicitly designed for proper alignment of manifolds. We present a new GAN called the Manifold-Aligning GAN (MAGAN) that aligns two manifolds such that related points in each measurement space are aligned together. We demonstrate applications of MAGAN in single-cell biology in integrating two different measurement types together. In our demonstrated examples, cells from the same tissue are measured with both genomic (single-cell RNA-sequencing) and proteomic (mass cytometry) technologies. We show that the MAGAN successfully aligns them such that known correlations between measured markers are improved compared to other recently proposed models.",

    "abstract": "Multi-domain translation seeks to learn a probabilistic coupling between marginal distributions that reflects the correspondence between different domains. We assume that data from different domains are generated from a shared latent representation based on a structural equation model. Under this assumption, we show that the problem of computing a probabilistic coupling between marginals is equivalent to learning multiple uncoupled autoencoders that embed to a given shared latent distribution. In addition, we propose a new framework and algorithm for multi-domain translation based on learning the shared latent distribution and training autoencoders under distributional constraints. A key practical advantage of our framework is that new autoencoders (i.e., new domains) can be added sequentially to the model without retraining on the other domains, which we demonstrate experimentally on image as well as genomics datasets.",

    "abstract": "Classical optimal transport problem seeks a transportation map that preserves the total mass betwenn two probability distributions, requiring their mass to be the same. This may be too restrictive in certain applications such as color or shape matching, since the distributions may have arbitrary masses and/or that only a fraction of the total mass has to be transported. Several algorithms have been devised for computing partial Wasserstein metrics that rely on an entropic regularization, but when it comes with exact solutions, almost no partial formulation of neither Wasserstein nor Gromov-Wasserstein are available yet. This precludes from working with distributions that do not lie in the same metric space or when invariance to rotation or translation is needed. In this paper, we address the partial Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein problems and propose exact algorithms to solve them. We showcase the new formulation in a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of optimal transport in this context and we first highlight that partial Wasserstein-based metrics prove effective in usual PU learning settings. We then demonstrate that partial Gromov-Wasserstein metrics is efficient in scenario where point clouds come from different domains or have different features.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method called integrated diffusion for combining multimodal datasets, or data gathered via several different measurements on the same system, to create a joint data diffusion operator. As real world data suffers from both local and global noise, we introduce mechanisms to optimally calculate a diffusion operator that reflects the combined information from both modalities. We show the utility of this joint operator in data denoising, visualization and clustering, performing better than other methods to integrate and analyze multimodal data. We apply our method to multi-omic data generated from blood cells, measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach better visualizes the geometry of the joint data, captures known cross-modality associations and identifies known cellular populations. More generally, integrated diffusion is broadly applicable to multimodal datasets generated in many medical and biological systems.",

The technique is a variation of Stochastic\nNeighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize,\nand produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the\ntendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is\nbetter than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals\nstructure at many different scales. This is particularly important for\nhigh-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related,\nlow-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple\nclasses seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure\nof very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on\nneighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data\nto influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We\nillustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and\ncompare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques,\nincluding Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The\nvisualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those\nproduced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.",

Our test statistic is the largest difference in expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and is called the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD).We present two distribution free tests based on large deviation bounds for the MMD, and a third test based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS. We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Generalized Unsupervised Manifold Alignment (GU-MA) method to build the connections between different but correlated datasets without any known correspondences. Based on the assumption that datasets of the same theme usually have similar manifold structures, GUMA is formulated into an explicit integer optimization problem considering the structure matching and preserving criteria, as well as the feature comparability of the corresponding points in the mutual embedding space. The main benefits of this model include: (1) simultaneous discovery and alignment of manifold structures; (2) fully unsuper-vised matching without any pre-specified correspondences; (3) efficient iterative alignment without computations in all permutation cases. Experimental results on dataset matching and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness and the practicability of our manifold alignment method.",

    "abstract": "Learning an ideal metric is crucial to many tasks in computer vision. Diverse feature representations may combat this problem from different aspects; as visual data objects described by multiple features can be decomposed into multiple views, thus often provide complementary information. In this paper, we propose a cross-view fusion algorithm that leads to a similarity metric for multiview data by systematically fusing multiple similarity measures. Unlike existing paradigms, we focus on learning distance measure by exploiting a graph structure of data samples, where an input similarity matrix can be improved through a propagation of graph random walk. In particular, we construct multiple graphs with each one corresponding to an individual view, and a cross-view fusion approach based on graph random walk is presented to derive an optimal distance measure by fusing multiple metrics. Our method is scalable to a large amount of data by enforcing sparsity through an anchor graph representation. To adaptively control the effects of different views, we dynamically learn view-specific coefficients, which are leveraged into graph random walk to balance multiviews. However, such a strategy may lead to an over-smooth similarity metric where affinities between dissimilar samples may be enlarged by excessively conducting cross-view fusion. Thus, we figure out a heuristic approach to controlling the iteration number in the fusion process in order to avoid over smoothness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We propose split-brain autoencoders, a straightforward modification of the traditional autoencoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method adds a split to the network, resulting in two disjoint sub-networks. Each sub-network is trained to perform a difficult task - predicting one subset of the data channels from another. Together, the sub-networks extract features from the entire input signal. By forcing the network to solve crosschannel prediction tasks, we induce a representation within the network which transfers well to other, unseen tasks. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale transfer learning benchmarks.",
