The integrative analysis of genomic data, collected at different molecular layers from diverse cell populations, holds promise to address the full-scale complexity of biological systems. However, the combination of different single-cell genomic signals is computationally challenging, as these data are intrinsically heterogeneous for experimental, technical and biological reasons.

More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.</jats:p>",

Here, we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability</jats:title><jats:p>Installation instructions, documentation, tutorials, and CITE-seq datasets are available at <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://www.satijalab.org/seurat\">http://www.satijalab.org/seurat</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec>",

While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility – for example generating paired measurements of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq – wide-spread application of joint profiling is challenging due to the experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging a novel interoperable neural network model, BABEL can generate scRNA-seq directly from a cell’s scATAC-seq, and vice versa. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multi-omic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to new biological contexts not seen during training. For example, starting from scATAC-seq of patient derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated scRNA-seq that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of the experimental BCC scRNA-seq data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as CITE-seq, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.</jats:p>",

The multi-head attention mechanism in a graph transformer considers the heterogeneous relation among cells and genes within both local and global context, making DeepMAPS robust to data noise and scale. We benchmarked DeepMAPS on 18 scMulti-omics datasets for cell clustering and biological network inference, and the results showed that our method outperformed various existing tools. We further applied DeepMAPS on lung tumor leukocyte CITE-seq data and matched diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. In both cases, DeepMAPS showed competitive performance in cell clustering and predicted biologically meaningful cell-cell communication pathways based on the inferred gene networks. Note that we deployed a webserver using DeepMAPS implementation equipped with multiple functions and visualizations to improve the feasibility and reproducibility of scMulti-omics data analysis. Overall, DeepMAPS represents a heterogeneous graph transformer for single-cell study and may benefit the use of scMulti-omics data in various biological systems.</jats:p>",

However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. In totalVI, the mRNA and protein measurements for each cell are generated from a low-dimensional latent random variable unique to that cell, representing its cellular state. totalVI uses deep neural networks to specify conditional distributions. By leveraging advances in stochastic variational inference, it scales easily to millions of cells. Explicit modeling of nuisance factors enables totalVI to produce denoised data in both domains, as well as a batch-corrected latent representation of cells for downstream analysis tasks.</jats:p>",

Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were relatively consistent within a single genetic sublineage. The genome-wide DNA demethylation patterns of cancer cells were consistent in all 10 patients whose DNA we sequenced. The cancer cells’ DNA demethylation degrees clearly correlated with the densities of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3 of normal tissue and those of repetitive element long interspersed nuclear element 1.

    "abstract": "<jats:p> It is possible to combine multiple latent-variable models of the same data by multiplying their probability distributions together and then renormalizing. This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "We propose a method called integrated diffusion for combining multimodal datasets, or data gathered via several different measurements on the same system, to create a joint data diffusion operator. As real world data suffers from both local and global noise, we introduce mechanisms to optimally calculate a diffusion operator that reflects the combined information from both modalities. We show the utility of this joint operator in data denoising, visualization and clustering, performing better than other methods to integrate and analyze multimodal data. We apply our method to multi-omic data generated from blood cells, measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach better visualizes the geometry of the joint data, captures known cross-modality associations and identifies known cellular populations. More generally, integrated diffusion is broadly applicable to multimodal datasets generated in many medical and biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Learning an ideal metric is crucial to many tasks in computer vision. Diverse feature representations may combat this problem from different aspects; as visual data objects described by multiple features can be decomposed into multiple views, thus often provide complementary information. In this paper, we propose a cross-view fusion algorithm that leads to a similarity metric for multiview data by systematically fusing multiple similarity measures. Unlike existing paradigms, we focus on learning distance measure by exploiting a graph structure of data samples, where an input similarity matrix can be improved through a propagation of graph random walk. In particular, we construct multiple graphs with each one corresponding to an individual view, and a cross-view fusion approach based on graph random walk is presented to derive an optimal distance measure by fusing multiple metrics. Our method is scalable to a large amount of data by enforcing sparsity through an anchor graph representation. To adaptively control the effects of different views, we dynamically learn view-specific coefficients, which are leveraged into graph random walk to balance multiviews. However, such a strategy may lead to an over-smooth similarity metric where affinities between dissimilar samples may be enlarged by excessively conducting cross-view fusion. Thus, we figure out a heuristic approach to controlling the iteration number in the fusion process in order to avoid over smoothness. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We propose split-brain autoencoders, a straightforward modification of the traditional autoencoder architecture, for unsupervised representation learning. The method adds a split to the network, resulting in two disjoint sub-networks. Each sub-network is trained to perform a difficult task - predicting one subset of the data channels from another. Together, the sub-networks extract features from the entire input signal. By forcing the network to solve crosschannel prediction tasks, we induce a representation within the network which transfers well to other, unseen tasks. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale transfer learning benchmarks.",
